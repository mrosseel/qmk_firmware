# Dvorak-centric planck keymap

## main features

* host computer OS can/should be in Dvorak layout for seamless switching between dvorak on planck and dvorak on e.g. laptop Keyboard
* number pad is under the right hand, as it is on a full scale number pad

## todos

* tap dance copy paste not working
* arrow keys on one row is still strange, should remap it to normal layout when e.g. holding the media play key
