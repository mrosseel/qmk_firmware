## main features

* host computer OS can/should be in Dvorak layout for seamless switching between dvorak on planck and dvorak on e.g. laptop Keyboard
* number pad is under the right hand, as it is on a full scale number pad, with the same layout.
* there is a tmux layer for various tmux commands. This layer also hosts other custom shortcuts
* When ESC is held, it activates MEH

## Compiling

make planck/rev4:miker

(note on how to recognise your revision: rev4 and before pcb boards are white, rev5 and later are black. 4 has a speaker, 3 doesn't.)

## todos

* arrow keys on one row is still strange, should remap it to normal layout when e.g. holding the media play key
